	/*	 Method : A method is a set of statements which represents the behavior of a class. 
	 * 					It is used to implement a specific functionality. In Java, every method must be part of some class. 
	 *  				A method can accept data as arguments or parameters.
	 *  				The arguments passed while making the method call are known as actual parameters.
	 *  				The arguments present in the method header are known as formal parameters.
	 *  				The result of a method can be given back by means of a return value by using return statement.
	 *  
	 *  Local variable : You can also declare variables inside a method. These variables are known as local variables.
	 *  						The scope of these variables is only within the method, i.e., they cannot be accessed outside the method. 
	 *  						Formal parameters are also local variables.
