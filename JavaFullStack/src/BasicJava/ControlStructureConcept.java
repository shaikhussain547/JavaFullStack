	/* In a program, the instructions are usually executed line by line. 
	 *  Sometimes, all the statements in a program may not be executed. 
	 *  There can be change in the flow of control and can be implemented using control structures.
	 *   Types of control structures :
	 *   		1. Sequential : All the statements are executed in the order in which it is written.
	 *   		2. Decision/Selection : Changes the flow of execution according to a condition or decision taken. E.g. if, if-else, switch
	 *   		3. Iteration : Repeatedly executes the same set of statements based on some condition. E.g. for, while, do-while.
	 */
	
	/* Switch case : Similar to if else statements, switch statement is also a selection control structure.
	 *  The switch statement enables to select a block from a set of options. It allows the flow of execution to be switched according to a value.
	 *   The set of statements present in that case are executed until a break statement is encountered or till the end of switch block, whichever occurs first
	 *   The switch block can have a special case called default.
	 *   The default case is executed when none of the cases match with the value of expression/variable. default is optional.
	 *   If none of the cases match and if there is no default statement, the control comes out of switch block without executing any case.
	 *   In Java, the switch block works only for the following data types:
	 *   				--> char and integral datatypes are supported in switch-case statement, but float or double are not supported.
	 *   				--> String datatype is also supported in switch-case statement.
