/* 	Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a type of programming approach which enables the programmers to work with real life entities 
 * 		like Customer, Trainee, Employee, Company, Product, Food, Book, etc.
 * 		Java, C#, Simula, JavaScript, Python, C++, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, Scala, PHP etc. are some of the popular oop languages.
 * 		OOP helps a programmer in breaking down the code into smaller modules. 
 * 		These modules (classes) will have state(represented by attributes/variables) and functionality (represented by behavior/methods).
 * 		These modules can then be used for representing the individual real life entities known as objects.
 * 
 * OOP has many advantages. Some of them are listed below:
 * 		1. Modularity: OOP enables programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when an object is added.
 * 		2. Scalability: OOP makes development and maintenance easier.
 * 		3. Data hiding: OOP provides hiding and securing data.
 * 		4. Real life scenario: OOP provides ability to simulate real world event more effectively and efficiently.
 * 
 * Class : A representation specifying the characteristics and behaviors of an object is called a class.
 * 				It is not a real life entity but a template for representing real life entities.
 * 				A class can have attributes (characteristics) and methods (behaviors).
 * 				Attributes are the elements or variables which hold the values or state of a particular entity.
 * 				Methods are the set of instructions which define the behaviors of the entity.
 * 				Class names in Java should follow pascal case. Pascal case are words created by concatenating capitalized words
 * 				E.g. - Customer, RegularCustomer.
 * 
 * Object : An object, which is an instance of a class is a real life entity which has some attributes and behaviors.
 * 					 The class determines the attributes and behaviors which an object should possess to belong to the class.
 * 
 * 				An object is an instance of a class.
 * 				An object holds data for every instance variable of a class.
 * 				It allows us to use the instance variables and methods specified in the class.
 * 				Any number of objects can be created for a class.
 * 				Method names and variables in Java should follow camel case. E.g. - customerName, contactNumber.
 * 				In camel case, each word in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no spaces or punctuation used between words.
